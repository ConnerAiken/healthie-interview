## Resources

I utilized 3 resources having limited knowledge of Ruby:

- https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.4/
- https://www.rubyguides.com/2015/07/ruby-threads/

## Assumptions

- I'll assume it doesn't matter if we randomize the generation
- I'll assume we don't need to keep references of all the possible prime numbers, just the largest
