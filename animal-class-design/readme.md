You can implement this any way you like, with whatever api you think makes sense. 

Include a driver file which requires the files, instantiates the classes, and invokes the methods to demonstrate the functionality. 

## Instructions
The driver file is `main.rb`, so run `ruby main.rb` and you will see output illustrating everything.
